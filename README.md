### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2022

+ Projec title: Exploring the difference between schools of philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Jiapeng.Xu

+ Project summary: For most people, philosophy maybe obscure and confusing. It usually takes lots of time to understand the overall conceptions between different schools of philosophy. However, taking advantage of this project, we can hand over this problem to our computer, solving this by NLP and machine learning. In this project, exploratory data analysis was first conducted to get some insights hidden in the dataset by visualizing. Then, according to the matrix of token counts, different schools of philosophy were clustered together to understand the similarity between them. In the last step, by using sentiment analysis classification, our algorithm acquired the ability to predict the corresponding school after seeing the sentence only.
